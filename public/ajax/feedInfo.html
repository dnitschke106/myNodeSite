<h2>Greek Connect Feed</h2>
<p>The social media feed for Greek Connect will be similar in function to many 
    social media feeds you have been previously exposed to. This will include posts (photo or video) 
    with interactive segments such as likes, comments, and saves. </p>
<p>Our feed is designed for users to connect through their alumni network. Your persobnal 
    feed will provide posts relevant to your personal chapter and span to posts created 
    across all members nationally.
</p>
<p>This will provide a netowrk for greek life members to connect and communicate with each other, 
    bringing a strong sense of community between many chapters that don't regularly communicate. 
</p>
<p>This fucntion is also relevant with alumni, so they can stay up to date and remain 
    knowledgeable on their fraternities status and well-being.
